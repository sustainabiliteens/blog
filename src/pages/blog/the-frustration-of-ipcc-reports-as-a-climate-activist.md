Dear Vote16,



PERIOD. Watching adults act like toddlers when making decisions about the livelihood of billions and then to have them turn to me and explain that I don’t know right from left is the most frustrating part of being a youth climate activist. Who knew that treating life as a human right was so “immature”.



A close second to that frustration, or maybeore accurately a condensation of that frustration, is the IPCC reports. For those of you who don’t know: the IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a part of the UN, and the modern day doomsayers that would be best compared to Cassandra. Every couple years they make a new report, describing the sorry state of affairs that is our climate. The report for 2021 came out earlier this morning, and it is quite something. 



Thousands of people tuned in to watch the broadcast (including me), and watched as some of the smartest people alive told us that we had basically missed our chance. Unless we take unprecedented, global scale action yesterday, 1.5* Celsius of global warming is unavoidable. Ocean levels will rise around 2 meters, or maybe even more depending on what choices we make. Extreme weather and heat will only get worse. And this report didn’t even talk about human lives lost (which will be next year). Basically, we didn’t do well enough after the Paris accords. 



The shittiest thing about the whole ordeal to me is that I didn’t learn anything. I could have told you most of this, maybe not down to the exact numbers, at any point in the past year. In fact most of the world could have, because we’ve been hearing the same thing for decades. It’s not surprising anymore. 



Despite that, Trudeau still bought a 12 billion dollar pipeline, the Horgan government increased fossil fuel subsidies two fold in the time they came into power, and municipalities all over the country haven’t declared this an emergency. 



I try to not let my emotions guide my work. I don’t think I would get out of bed if I did. But this has come close to breaking me. Such a stark reminder that we are unequivocally fucked and that it is our fault as humans. Already I’ve sunk hundreds of hours into seemingly fruitless work: trying to coordinate events, talk to politicians, fix internal issues and just in general engage in the political world. And that’s not even close to some other people I can think of, who are routinely up until sunrise working on this shit. And most days it doesn’t feel like I’ve accomplished anything. Most days just feel like failure. But I keep telling myself it’s good to be fighting, that someone somewhere will see what we do and take solid action that will save our planet. But realistically? I’m probably going to spend the rest of my life trying to get something to happen, only to see most of Richmond underwater and the rest of BC consumed by wildfires. BECAUSE THEY DON’T. FUCKING. LISTEN. Forest, lakes and glaciers will disappear, swept away by fires or heat waves or droughts. Ho uses will be destroyed, thrown into other houses by tornadoes or cyclones. All because we ‘needed our jobs’, here, in a ‘developed’ nation that could have had [thousands more jobs with a green economy](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/04/green-economy-could-create-24-million-new-jobs/) . Millions of people, even billions, will be displaced or killed because of our inaction. Children, barely old enough to crawl will die of heat stroke. Toddlers, barely old enough to say “mama” will drown in floods. School kids, just learning about subtraction, will be burned  in fires. 



This is what my future is. How can I have kids knowing that?
