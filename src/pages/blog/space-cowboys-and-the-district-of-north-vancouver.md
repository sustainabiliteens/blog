Dear Vote16,



I want to start this post by acknowledging and showing my appreciation for the previous piece, published by Kiran. It was an excellent and insightful piece, that drew attention to some enormous issues in our society.

That being said, I think it’s time we move on to a slightly sillier topic, and where else to start but the billionaire space race which has been cracking me up for the past few weeks. For those of you who don’t know, at some point or another someone decided space should be a tourist destination and Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Richard Branson and some others took that idea and, well, shot for the stars with it. In the past two weeks alone, both Branson and Bezos have spent time in space, along with some passengers (hostages depending on who you ask), and have returned safely home. Unsurprisingly, this has sparked an all out internet war between the social conscious - who think this was a flagrant misuse of wealth and an embodiment of the evil which is capitalism - and the …. other people? To be honest I’m not sure who they are but they are there and they are weird and they seem to think that this is the start of a new age of the human species. But to the side of this debate is a small group of people who, I believe, see this situation for what it really is: fucking hilarious.



Now don’t get me wrong: it is really messed up. To decide it would be a better use of millions of dollars to go to space for a couple minutes than to say, help the Red Cross or help with climate change or any of the other billion problems that need to be fixed is childish. But I really have a hard time seeing it as anything but that. Malicious? No, that would be investing in oil and gas companies. Evil?! No, that would be using that money to put Mexican children in cages at the border. But childish? Yes, absolutely. These people had a dream as a kid, a dream that most kids have, to go to space. And all of a sudden, they found themselves rich enough to fulfill that dream. So they did! No remorse, no second thoughts, just “Oooooooooo the stars are shiny” and BOOM liftoff. And you know what? That’s funny to me. Little kids are funny, and these little kids happen to be full grown adults. And they went to space in the middle of a pandemic, during a climate crisis, while one of the biggest social movements ever is still making waves around the world. It honestly sounds like the premise of the next Micheal Bay movie.



Here’s the bit where you have to bear with me, because I’m going to connect this all back to the District of North Vancouver’s latest council meeting. I think at the heart of this space race is something that is really defining our world these days, and that is a disconnect from reality. Some people just don’t play the same game as everyone else, even when it comes to something as seemingly benign as being able to access shade during a heat wave. That disconnect can lead to statements like how we should move all polluting industries to space (just so strange), and that disconnect translates into dumb descisions, descisions that could have serious impacts far, far into our future. Maybe going to space isn’t one of them, but the decision to not immediately start moving our energy towards renewables after the paris agreement was. To expand on this idea of a disconnect, I look towards the age of the people making these decisions. The US’s president is a senior. The average age of senators in Canada was somewhere around 65, and for the House of Commons it’s about 51. Of course they’re making bad decisions about the future, they won’t be around to see them through. 



The solution? Get youth voices involved. Solve at least part of the disconnect issue (the disconnect between socio-economic classes is also horrendous, but much harder to fix), by making sure the people who’s future we vote on have a say in their futures. So when the District of North Vancouver voted to endorse the Vote16 campaign, we moved a step in the right direction. See I told you I could do it. 



But now I’m out of space so I must say goodbye and farewell! I’m excited to hear back from you all.
