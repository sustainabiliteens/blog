Dear Susustainabiliteens,



There was quite an unexpected comparison between rich space cowboys and the District of North Vancouver’s decision to endorse Vote 16 in Vijay’s comedic, yet captivating piece. I want to focus on how the post clearly highlights a debunk for one of the biggest misconceptions folks, as in older folks (if you ask me), have regarding  lowering the voting age to 16—“the young ones are immature”.



Those who like to undermine youth get an overflow of boiling blood when they hear that “little children” are fighting for the right to vote at 16. Apparently, the same “little children” that pay taxes, drive, can get married, and are at the legal age of consent are just too inexperienced in the world of adults to know anything about systemic processes and their rights.



Now, excuse me if I sound like a pillar of salt, it’s just that I find it ironic that we’re bashing on teenagers who are given heaps of responsibilities, all while making decisions for their future and taking all the shit that’s thrown at them by adults, when children in adult bodies—with the right to vote—are greeting the moon and touching the stars. To me, it sounds like these grown-ups are acting a whole lot younger than the youth. By all means, good for you Jeff, Elon and Richard. All I’m saying is that curiosity just shot me like a shooting star when reflecting upon my inability to voice my needs in the province when my future is decided for me by those who won't be around long enough to see me choke on the smoky air or work overtime to pay for Vancouver housing. 



Do you see it now? Anyone can act a little silly or childish, so what’s the point in demeaning youth for their maturity levels when we have adults that can run the world like it's a giant play zone? I could ramble on and blab about the ageism that built this poor misconception, but that’ll be for another day. 



Let’s take a step into one of the biggest present-day disasters we are all in—the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of us youth are essential workers in this never-ending pandemic, and still, these adults are not asking themselves: what would we do without them? Why do we expect teens to do so much, yet deprive them of the right to vote? I don’t see any reason why these questions wouldn’t be brought up more frequently.  These conversations are what helps us to establish a collaborative comprehension as to why the District of North Vancouver voted to help give youth a voice in politics at the provincial level of government. And where will that get us? Higher voter turnout (lifelong, might I add), further democratization in the electoral system, and a just future for the next MLA’s, poets, and surgeons.   



So, I guess if someone asked me what my two cents are on Jeff Bezos and his buddies going to space as a 17-year-old concerned about youth voices in BC, my answer would look something like this: space seems like loads of fun, but don’t talk about youth immaturity if you’re all for rich adults jumping around in space.
