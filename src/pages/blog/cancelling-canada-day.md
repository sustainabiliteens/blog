Dear Vote16BC,



It's been almost a week since July 1st, a very fraught national holiday for the colonial state of Canada. For me, this has been a week of unlearning and reimagining my identity as a settler and an activist on the unceded land of the səl̓ilw̓ətaʔɬ, sḵwx̱wú7mesh, and xʷməθkʷəy̓əm nations.



For my immigrant family, "Canada" represented a safe-haven in their search for a better life for their children. They worked hard to get here and keep themselves safe. But along with the safety came a precarious need to fit in. Lest they be rejected by the white-supremacist, colonial norms of their new home, my grandparents clung to "normal": ignoring the Indigenous people of Turtle Island at all costs. To realise and understand that this was not our land made you an outsider and a target. 



As their descendant living in a time of social change and uprising, I am painfully aware of how destructive these supposedly safe patterns are. No one can draw their identity, their culture or their security from "Canada" without reinforcing the genocide of Indigenous nations. "Canada" is built on the unmarked graves of children, the skeletons of villages crushed under concrete and the ghosts of lost culture. For all its supposed merit as a country, "Canada" is guilty of genocide. Until settlers like me and the government get comfortable with that simple fact, we cannot have reconciliation. It is not right for any settlers to call this place home or abuse the privilege living here affords us until the rightful inhabitants and landowners stop being murdered, ignored and stripped of their culture. This is not a truly safe place for immigrants if the people who belong to the land are still unsafe.



So for the past few years, I've been grappling with how I can ground myself in an identity that doesn't rely on the settler state. Especially as a settler activist, how can I make sure my activism is truly decolonial, when I am a product of colonialism? Of course, the answer is always learning from Indigenous people. 



As a settler, it's easy to get scared of change. The colonial system is designed to work in my favour, so complacency will always be the easier option. But it is never the better option. It’s always better to fight for what you believe in, or at least against what you don’t. So this year when it came time to celebrate “Canada Day” - mere weeks after the discovery of thousands of unmarked children’s graves from residential schools- people decided to choose the better option, by protesting against this celebration of genocide, violence and opression. And it was incredible. Protest can feel violent and scary, and is by nature an intense, almost aggressive act, fuelled by the need for change and the infuriating reality of deep injustice. But that’s not all. It can be fun, exciting, energising and a great way to connect with the community. No movement can sustain itself on anger alone. So with that in mind, the thousands of people who came out to protest on July 1st were angry. We wanted change, and we wanted it yesterday. But we also danced, sang, laughed at a Lady Gaga parody, all while very seriously protesting the Canadian government's ignorance of genocide. But there was a sense of hope at the base of it all, a hope for a better tomorrow, a more just tomorrow. 



Yes, North America needs a massive upheaval of our current comfortable, genocidal system. But that overhaul will be towards something so much better. Of course it won't be easy, but the best outcomes never are. And to be clear, the goal isn't to fight fire with fire. There won't be more violence, hopefully from either side of this conversation. There will be dialogue, understanding and community building.



How do we, as young activists, build a decolonial world out of a colonial state? By learning from Indigenous people and centering joy alongside justice. Joy and anger are not polar opposites. They complement each other as the recipe for change. "Canada" needs to embrace that contradiction and welcome the challenge. The first step? We need to stop celebrating a country founded on genocide with a holiday meant to instil national pride into its citizens. 



But of course, “Canada” Day isn’t the only day we need to create change, it needs to be everyone, everyday, fighting for a future where families aren’t shattered, lives aren’t taken, and where anyone’s culture, European or not, is not only tolerated but celebrated. And to do that we need to remember: approaching the future with hope and a resilient community will always be more powerful than silence.
